# Regression-Models

The inspiration for this project came from my lifelong interest in Gastropods. For the purpose of this project I am investigating data of Blacklip Abalone (subspecies: Haliotis rubra). The reason why I have chosen this dataset rests largely in the fact that Blacklip Abalone are a species victim to artificial farming and environmental concerns such as overfishing and environment deterioration. By investigating a sample of an already diminishing wild population, I hope to gain some insights before this wild subspecies goes extinct in the near future.

In the first notebook (Haliotis Rubra_Overview.ipynb) I perform an exploration of the dataset, by looking at different distributions while investigating the relationship between key variables by means of variance models and interaction plots. The second notebook (Haliotis Rubra_ResearchQuestions.ipynb) contains a detailed exploration of multiple research questions through linear regression models, anovas, multinomial regression models and correlation tests.


## Description of variables in context:

**Sex:** Male (M), Female (F), and Infant (I)

**Length:** Longest shell measurement (mm)

**Diameter:** Measurement perpendicular to length (mm)

**Height:** Height as measured with with meat in shell (mm)

**Whole weight:** whole abalone weight pre-bleeding (grams)

**Shucked weight:** weight of meat (grams)

**Viscera weight:** gut weight post-bleeding (grams)

**Shell weight:** weight after being dried (grams)

**Rings:** Integer number of rings per specimen
